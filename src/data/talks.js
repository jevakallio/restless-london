    synopsis: <>
      <p>
        Developing a real-world full-stack app often involves tedious threading of data across multiple layers of the stack.
        This is particularly undesirable during prototyping phases where the main goal may be just to demonstrate an idea or design.
        Itâ€™s also risky when going to production since data inconsistencies between the layers can lead to bugs.
        We show one solution to this velocity and type-safety dilemma via Nexus combined with Prisma.
